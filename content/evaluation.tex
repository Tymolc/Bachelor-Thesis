\subsection{Visual Odometry to record Racing Lines}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pro: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Many datapoints (in theory up to frame rate positions per second)
  \item Capable of detecting fairly slight movements
  \item No need for external sensors (apart from camera which already exists)
  \item works in every environment (especially where there is no or poor GPS signal)
  \end{itemize}

\item Con:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item uses fairly expensive operations
  \item in praxis mobile-range computers will only reach up to 10 fps
  \item no constant speed (slows down in areas with many feature points (like forests))
  \item fairly error prone
  \item rounding errors and inaccurate calculations add up and distort the racing line
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Usefulness of Racing Line Comparison}
\begin{itemize}
  \item professional drivers can achieve similar lap times with very different racing lines
  \item however amateur and intermediate drivers can learn a lot from more skilled drivers
\end{itemize}
