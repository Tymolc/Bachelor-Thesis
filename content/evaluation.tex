\subsection{Visual Odometry to record Racing Lines}
\begin{easylst}
Pro: 
&Many Datapoints (in theory up to Framerate positions per second)
&Capable of detecting fairly slight movements
&No need for external sensors (apart from camera which already exists)
&works in every environment (especially where there is no or poor GPS signal)

Con:
&uses fairly expensive operations
&&in praxis mobile-range computers will only reach up to 10 fps
&no constant speed (slows down in areas with many feature points (like forests))
&fairly error prone
&&rounding errors and inaccurate calculations add up and distort the racing line
\end{easylist}
