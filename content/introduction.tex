\subsection{Motivation}
The trajectory around a track that allows a given vehicle to traverse the circuit in the minimum amount of time is called the ideal racing line. Needless to say, in a race this is the path every driver wants to take. In reality, however, this isn't an easy task. In order to achieve best times, a racing driver has to remember exactly which corner of the track comes next, how fast they can take this corner, see how the car is positioned on the track and process many more information.
